This code resets the original data and then overwrites it with random values n times.

It's important to remember that there is no foolproof way to completely erase data from memory. Advanced techniques such as memory forensics or hardware-level attacks can still recover some or all of the original data. In addition, there may be other areas where sensitive data is stored, such as temporary files or swap space, which may also need to be cleared.
